Metawidget for JavaScript
=========================

The folder /lib contains the JavaScript version of Metawidget.

It is broken into subfolders for different JavaScript frameworks, such as /lib/metawidget/angular for AngularJS. These futher rely on /lib/metawidget/core which contains pure, framework-independent JavaScript code.
