Metawidget for JavaScript
=========================

The folder /lib contains the JavaScript version of Metawidget.

It is broken into subfolders for different JavaScript frameworks, such as /lib/metawidget/angular for AngularJS. These futher rely on /lib/metawidget/core which contains pure, framework-independent JavaScript code.

/lib/metawidget/core/metawidget-core.min.js contains the aggregated, minified version of metawidget/core. You should use metawidget-core.min.js on its own, in preference to the other files in metawidget/core (which are the un-aggregated, un-minified version).
