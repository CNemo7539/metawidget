Metawidget for GWT
==================

The file metawidget-all-sources.jar contains Metawidget source code. It is only needed when *compiling* GWT applications (see http://metawidget.sourceforge.net/doc/reference/en/html/ch03s03.html#section-metawidgets-web-gwt).

It is *not* recommended to try and build Metawidget from this packaged source code. It lacks project files, an easy-to-use structure, and third-party library dependencies. Instead, please download the source distribution (see http://metawidget.org).
