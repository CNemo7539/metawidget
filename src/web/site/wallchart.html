		<h2>Wallchart</h2>
		
		<p>
			The Metawidget wallchart is a large UML class diagram showing which technologies Metawidget
			can mix and match, and what configuration options are available. The wallchart includes all supported
			back-end technologies (shown in red), desktop frameworks (shown in green), web frameworks
			(shown in blue) and mobile frameworks (shown in yellow). 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It's a great tool both for familiarising yourself with the overall architecture
			of Metawidget, and for exploring what plugins are available. It is downloadable as a
			PNG image designed to be printed across two pieces of landscape A3 or A4 paper.
