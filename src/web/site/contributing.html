						<th>Suggestion</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Maven support</th>
						<td>
							Metawidget integrates with lots of third-party libraries, each of which is continually being
							updated by their respective owners. Adding Maven support would help other contributors
							maintain version dependencies.
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>SWT support</th>
						<td>
							Metawidget's desktop support currently only includes Swing. A version for SWT, probably
							modelled closely off SwingMetawidget, would expand our desktop coverage.  
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>ZK support</th>
						<td>
							ZK is a very popular Web framework, and has interesting architectual differences
							compared to our currently supported Web frameworks.
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>OSGi support</th>
						<td>
							OSGi is an important standard for modular development. Adding OSGi headers
							to the Metawidget JAR would make it more useful in many environments. See
							<a href="http://www.aqute.biz/Code/Bnd">http://www.aqute.biz/Code/Bnd</a>.
