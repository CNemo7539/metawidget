		<h2>Contributing</h2>
		
		<p>
			Metawidget is developed by the community. Our mission is:			
		</p>
		
		<h3 style="text-align: center">
			To develop and promote the industry's most practical User Interface generator, by automating
			and integrating with as many existing technologies as possible  
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			We say <strong>industry</strong> to emphasize our target of diverse, real-world, mainstream applications: not
			just prototypes or niche products. We say <strong>most practical</strong> to mean not
			trying to 'own' the entire UI, but to focus on being a native subcomponent
			for slotting into existing UIs. Also, to mean performing UI generation at runtime not
			through static code generation.
			Finally, we say <strong>existing technologies</strong> to mean working with as many existing back-end architectures and programming
			languages, and as many existing front-end frameworks as possible.

						<td>
							Metawidget integrates with lots of third-party libraries, each of which is continually being
