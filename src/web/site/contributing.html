				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Suggestion</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Flex support</th>
						<td>
							Flex is a popular RIA platform and has interesting architectual differences
							compared to our currently supported Web frameworks. In particular, it is not
							Java-based.
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>JavaFX support</th>
						<td>
							JavaFX is a new platform for RIA development. Whilst you can already
							use SwingMetawidget via <tt>javafx.ext.swing.SwingComponent.wrap</tt>, a native
							JavaFxMetawidget (ie. that extended <tt>javafx.scene.Node</tt>, used JavaFX binding, etc)
							would be most welcome.
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Maven support</th>
						<td>
							Metawidget integrates with lots of third-party libraries, each of which is continually being
							updated by their respective owners. Adding Maven support would help other contributors
							maintain version dependencies.
						</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>ZK support</th>
						<td>
							ZK is a very popular Web framework, and has interesting architectual differences
							compared to our currently supported Web frameworks.
						</td>
