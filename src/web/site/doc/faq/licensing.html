		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - Licensing</h2>
		
		<p>
			Metawidget is Free Software.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Metawidget is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_blank">LGPL</a>. The LGPL is sufficiently flexible
			to allow the use of Metawidget in both open source and commercial projects.
			The LGPL guarantees that Metawidget and any modifications made to Metawidget will stay open source, protecting our and your work. Anyone who
			wanted to release Metawidget under a different license would have to obtain permission from everybody who has contributed code to Metawidget,
			which would be impractical. Metawidget is and will be open source distributed under the LGPL.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Using Metawidget (by importing Metawidget's public interfaces in your code), and extending Metawidget (by subclassing or implementation of an
			extension interface) is considered by the authors of Metawidget to be dynamic linking. Hence our interpretation of the LGPL is that the use
			of the unmodified Metawidget source does not affect the license of your application code.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The use of the unmodified Metawidget binary of course never affects the license of your application or distribution. The LGPL also forbids
			distribution for profit, so you will never have to pay money to any commercial entity for using or integrating Metawidget.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you modify Metawidget and redistribute your modifications, the LGPL applies. Please submit any modifications to our <a href="${context}/issues.html">issue tracker</a>.
