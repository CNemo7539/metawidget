		<h3><a name="what">What is Metawidget?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Metawidget is an object/user interface mapping tool. The term object/user interface mapping (OIM) refers to the
			technique of inspecting objects, at runtime, and creating User Interface (UI) widgets.
		</p>

		<p>
			As much as possible, Metawidget does this without introducing new technologies. Metawidget inspects an application's
			<em>existing</em> back-end architecture and creates widgets native to its <em>existing</em> front-end framework.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="who">Who makes Metawidget?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Metawidget is an Open Source project licensed under the <a href="${context}/doc/faq/licensing.html">LGPL</a>. It is developed by the
			community. It was started by Richard Kennard of <a href="http://www.kennardconsulting.com" target="_blank">Kennard Consulting</a>.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="goals">What are the goals of Metawidget?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Metawidget continues the trend in recent years toward more POJO-centric development. This trend allows
			developers to rely on 'sensible defaults', writing as little 'boilerplate code' as possible. The Goals Of
			Metawidget are:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>to create UI widgets by inspecting existing back-end architectures</li>
			<li>not to try to 'own' the entire UI, but to focus on creating native sub-widgets for slotting into existing UIs</li>
			<li>to perform inspection <em>at runtime</em>, detecting types and subtypes dynamically</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Note it is <em>not</em> a goal of Metawidget that the widgets look the same on every UI framework: every UI has
			different features, and Metawidget takes advantage of this.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="requirements">What are Metawidget's system requirements?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Metawidget requires at least J2SE 1.4, and varies depending on which optional modules you use.
		</p>

		<p>
			Its annotation support requires at least Java SE 5. Its <tt>javax.swing.GroupLayout</tt> support requires at
			least Java SE 6.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="why">Why is it called Metawidget?</a></h3>

		<p>
			The name has two meanings:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>a 'widget' is the technical term for a Graphical User Interface component (such as a text box). A 'meta' widget is a widget composed of other widgets.</li>
			<li>Metawidget is a widget built by metadata gathered from the back-end</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><a name="impl">Why is (some feature) of Metawidget implemented the way it is?</a></h3>

		<p>
			See the <a href="${context}/blogs.html">developer blogs</a> for insights into, and to provide feedback on, Metawidget's development.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="usage">Who uses Metawidget?</a></h3>

		<p>
			As of v0.5, the Java Server Faces Metawidget is deployed in 2 medium-sized production systems.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="web">Is Metawidget (yet) another Web application framework?</a></h3>

		<p>
			No. Metawidget <em>uses</em> existing Web application frameworks, it does not compete with them.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="compare">How does Metawidget compare to Swing/Hibernate/(some other framework)?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Metawidget <em>uses</em> other frameworks, it does not compete with them.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="compete">Who are Metawidget's competitors?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Whilst there are other projects that address automatic UI generation, we are not aware of any with the same
			<a href="#goals">goals as Metawidget</a>:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://3layer.no-ip.info:6666/confluence/display/MERLIN/Home" target="_blank">Merlin</a>: does
			not share goal 1 - inspect existing back-end technologies using pluggable inspectors</li> 
			<li><a href="http://www.nakedobjects.org" target="_blank">Naked Objects</a>, <a href="http://www.jmatter.org" target="_blank">JMatter</a>
			and <a href="http://www.openxava.org" target="_blank">OpenXava</a>: do not share goal 2 - create native sub-widgets
			rather than 'owning' the entire UI</li>
			<li><a href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.0.1.GA/reference/en/html/gettingstarted.html" target="_blank">Seam-Gen</a>: does not share goal 3 - perform runtime UI generation, as opposed to static code generation</a>
		</ul>

		<h3><a name="oim">Is an OIM like an ORM?</a></h3>

		<p>
			Object Relational Mapping (ORM) technologies, such as Hibernate, are concerned with the back-end: mapping an Object (the <em>O</em> in
			ORM) to a Relational Database (the <em>R</em> in ORM). Object Interface Mapping (OIM) technologies, such as Metawidget, are concerned
			with the front-end: mapping an Object (the <em>O</em> in OIM) to a User Interface framework (the <em>I</em> in OIM).
		</p>

		<p>
			OIMs and ORMs are complementary and meet in the middle: they share the same <em>O</em>. By using an OIM in conjunction with
			an ORM, developers can significantly reduce the amount of code required for an application.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="mature">Is Metawidget mature?</a></h3>

		<p>
			As of v0.5, Metawidget has <a href="../../coverage.html">good test coverage</a>, but is not mature. Please <a href="../../contributing.html">help us</a> as we work towards a v1.0 release!
