Testing The Old Fashioned Way :)
--------------------------------

This process needs to be upgraded once Android has unit testing support.

For Android AllWidgets, test:

* The layout is a LinearLayout (including the nested layouts)
* All values are populated (including 'Nested Textbox 1' twice and again in 'Nested Textbox 1, Nested Textbox 2')
* Textarea field is large
* Password field is masked
* Numeric fields do not accept alpha characters (incl primitive/object types. Note floats must accept alpha so that you can enter a dot)
* There is no label for longObject
* There is a label 'nullInBundle'
* There is no label for doubleObject
* All dropdowns have a blank choice available, except notNullDropdown and notNullObjectDropdown
* The mystery field is a text box
* 'Futher nested widgets' appears 3 times (twice up top, once down bottom)
* There is a section break

Editing all values and choosing 'Save' (from the menu) reports the changed values as a read-only screen. Test:

* All values appear (except mystery value)
* Password label appears but has a blank line for the value
* Boolean object saves correctly (ie. 'Yes' maps to 'true')
