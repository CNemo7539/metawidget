Testing The Old Fashioned Way :)
--------------------------------

Most testing is automated by SwingAddressBookTest. In addition, make sure:

1. Open an existing Contact and click 'Edit'. Does the screen repaint to show active components?
2. Right click in the Communications table. Is there a 'Delete' menu?
