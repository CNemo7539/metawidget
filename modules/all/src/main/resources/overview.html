		<h2>Metawidget API Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			Metawidget is an object/user interface mapping tool. The term
			object/user interface mapping (OIM) refers to
			the technique of inspecting objects, at runtime, and creating
			User Interface (UI) widgets.
		</p>

		<p>
			As much as possible, Metawidget does this without introducing
			additional technologies. Metawidget inspects an application's
			<em>existing</em> back-end architecture (such as JavaBeans, annotations,
			XML configuration files) and creates widgets native to its
			<em>existing</em> front-end framework (such as Swing, Java Server Faces, Struts or
			Android).
